# AI will help frugality

Reflecting how gen AI is now used for software development and knowing it's limitations in term of context window I think that it could force as developers to make smaller systems.
I'm working on really large payroll and accounting systems and AI cant get the full system in it's context. So to take full advantage of it we should go for lighter smaller smaller code base
For me this is could be a real opportunity to go to more frugal tech. 

What do you think of it?
